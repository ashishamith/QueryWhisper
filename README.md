# 🔍 QueryWhisper

**QueryWhisper** is a Flask-based AI-powered app that transforms **natural language questions** into **SQL queries**, executes them safely on a MySQL database, and returns results with a clear explanation.  
Powered by **Groq’s LLaMA 3**, it makes querying databases as simple as chatting with an assistant.

## ⚙️ **Installation & Setup**

1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashishamith/QueryWhisper.git
cd QueryWhisper

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt


3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
MYSQL_DATABASE=ecommerce


4️⃣ Run the App

python app.py
The app will start at:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000


▶️ Working Flow

Here’s how QueryWhisper works step by step:

🔑 1. Login

User enters username & password on /login

After authentication → redirected to Dashboard



❓ 2. Ask a Question

Example: "Which city has the most customers?"



🧠 3. Natural Language → SQL

LLaMA3 (Groq API) converts the question into an optimized SQL query

Example:

SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_customers DESC
LIMIT 1;



🛡️ 4. SQL Safety Check

Regex filter ensures only SELECT queries are allowed

Blocks dangerous queries: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP




⚡ 5. Execute Query

Safe SQL runs against the connected MySQL database

Raw results are fetched




🤖 6. AI Explanation

LLaMA3 generates a short, human-friendly answer

Example: "Delhi has the highest number of customers (15)."



📂 7. Store Report

Saves Question, SQL, AI Answer in /report/query_logs.csv



📊 8. Return Results

Dashboard displays:

✅ Generated SQL

✅ Query result table

✅ AI-generated explanation



💡 Example Queries

"Show the top 3 cities with the highest number of customers"

"What is the ratio of customers in Delhi vs Mumbai?"

"Which states have more Gmail users than Yahoo users?"

"Find the most common last name among customers"
